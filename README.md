# StMPI

Many MPI implementations have been done such as MPICH, OpenMP, MSMPI and JavaMPI. This project does not do a new MPI implementation from scratch but rather bind Smalltalk language with C language to use other MPI in Smalltalk. This implementation is named StMPI. An image processing application and prime number application were created to test StMPI performance. The source code for the application is provided. Download the full application here, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oL8XaFfwhprqioUysIIDMo9VX2--6T6A/view?usp=sharing and here, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uyM_wGf6dnJ8HNnNEF9iWiy61o9085zT/view?usp=sharing.

Its was aimed to help Smalltalk prominent user to get the most performance speed in their program by allowing them to do parallel computing. StMPI is created to run on both Windows and Linux environments. You can implement it on your system by following the guideline provided.

There is one field that could be explored based on this project which is to use StMPI as a medium to communicate between Smalltalk programs to another programming language program. The image processing application and prime number application uses both the Smalltalk programming language and C++ programing language. This just shows that you could use StMPI as a communication medium between programming languages.
