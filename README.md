# StMPI

There are many MPI implementations that have been done such as MPICH, OpenMP,
MSMPI and JavaMPI. This project does not do a new MPI implementation from scratch
but rather bind Smalltalk language with C language to use other MPI in Smalltalk. This implementation is
named StMPI. An image processing application and prime number application were created to test StMPI performance.

Its was aimed to help Smalltalk prominent user to get the most performance speed in their program by allowing them
to do parallel computing. StMPI is created to run on both Windows and Linux environment. You can implement it on your system by following the guideline provided.

There is one field that could be explored based on this project which is to use StMPI as a medium to communicate
between Smalltalk programs to another programming language program. I have explained about my image processing application that uses both
the Smalltalk programming language and C++ programing language. This just
shows that you could use StMPI as a communication medium between programming languages. This would be great for industries that already use Smalltalk in their system but want to integrate it with another programming language.
